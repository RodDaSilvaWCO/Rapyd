# Rapyd
In this repository is the Rapyd API integration work I did in support of my entry for the Formula 0001:  Rapyd FinTech Grand Prix Hackathon.

The RapydManager.cs file contains the APIs I added to the UnoSys.API to be abel to wrap Rapyd's APIs.

The UnoSys.API.cs contains other APIs to integrate with the Hedera Hashgraphy public distributed ledger (Test Net only).

All other .cs files are used by the RapydManger to describe Rapyd API request and/or response objects.
